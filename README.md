1.	Project Details
Problem: The data shared between users in any chatting apps nowadays are not encrypted and can easily be intervened externally.
Solution: This project is about making a chatting app in which data transfer at both ends of the users, would be encrypted. However, in this project, the main idea is to make an encrypted group chatting app and not only one-to-one. Also the app would be made for Android OS only. 

2.	Features
•	Data sharing between users 
•	Protected sharing
•	Interactive user interface
•	Easy to install and use

3.	Technology: Android Studio would be used to make this app. For the decryption and encryption purpose, RSA algorithm would be used.

4.	Monetization/Business plan: The app would be free to use. However, there can many methods of monetization. In the home page, there would be ads displayed, clicking on which the user would be directed to the advertised product. They can then buy the products on which the app company may charge a commission on sales. If users do not want advertisements, they can upgrade to a premium ad-free service. Also, there can be in-app purchases made, where users can buy stickers or any other service out of the ordinary.

Since the app is made in Bangladesh, the method of accessing the paid services is through mobile financial services such as bKash or UCash. Here, the users can easily complete the payment in a way which is familiar to them to attain the privileges.
